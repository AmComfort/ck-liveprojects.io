## 📂**Industry Experience**

### Aviation

#### 1. Cloud-Native Flight Operations Platform (AWS + Terraform + EKS)
Modernized mission-critical flight-operations systems used for crew scheduling, flight tracking, and ground operations.

**Highlights:**
- Designed AWS infrastructure using Terraform (VPC, EKS, RDS, ALB, IAM with aviation-compliance standards).
- Built GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines supporting automated tests, security scans, and canary deployments.
- Implemented multi-AZ EKS clusters with autoscaling to handle peak flight-event traffic.
- Set up observability: CloudWatch dashboards, metrics, structured logs, and SLO-driven alerts.
- Strengthened IAM, encryption, and governance aligned with FAA security guidelines.

**Impact:** Increased platform uptime to 99.99% and enabled daily, low-risk deployments.

#### 2. Real-Time Passenger & Baggage Tracking (Serverless Architecture)
Developed an event-driven platform for passenger notifications, baggage tracking, and gate-change events.

**Highlights:**
- Built Lambda- and DynamoDB-based architecture with Terraform.
- Implemented SQS/SNS pipelines for resilient data ingestion.
- Designed CI/CD for packaging and deploying serverless functions.
- Added audit trails, encryption, and regulatory compliance controls.

**Impact:** Reduced baggage-update processing delays by 40% and improved real-time passenger experiences.

### Banking (Financial Services)

#### 3. Secure Multi-Environment Cloud Platform for Digital Banking (Terraform + ECS)
Supported digital banking teams building high-availability, compliant cloud services.

**Highlights:**
- Implemented Terraform + Terragrunt across dev, test, and prod environments.
- Built Jenkins pipelines with unit tests, SAST/DAST scanning, tfsec/Checkov, and approval gating.
- Migrated APIs to ECS Fargate with blue/green and canary deployments.
- Integrated CloudTrail, Config, and KMS encryption for compliance (PCI-DSS, FFIEC, SOC2).

**Impact:** Reduced manual ops by 60% and improved overall security posture.

#### 4. Enterprise Observability & Reliability Program (SRE-focused)
Built a centralized monitoring and alerting ecosystem for critical transaction systems.

**Highlights:**
- Deploying Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK for unified monitoring.
- Implemented SLIs/SLOs, error budgets, and automated runbooks.
- Integrated CloudWatch logs/metrics with SIEM for fraud/anomaly detection.
- Improved MTTR with actionable dashboards and alert hygiene.

**Impact:** Reduced incident detection and recovery times, increasing service reliability for customers.


### 4. SRE Observability & Reliability Initiative
Built a centralized monitoring and alerting ecosystem:
- Prometheus federation & Grafana dashboards  
- CloudWatch custom metrics + anomaly detection  
- Error budget policy implementation  
- Runbook automation using Lambda & SSM  
Outcome: Improved incident response time by 40% and reduced alert noise by 60%.

About Me

I am a DevOps and Site Reliability Engineer with a decade of hands-on experience delivering resilient, scalable, and automated infrastructure across cloud and hybrid environments. My career began in foundational IT support systems, troubleshooting networks, and managing on-prem servers, which gave me a deep understanding of how infrastructure behaves at every layer. Over the years, I transitioned into cloud engineering, automation, and DevOps practices, steadily building a strong technical foundation and a practical, problem-solving mindset.

I hold a Bachelor’s in Information Technology and a Master’s in Information Systems, which provide both the technical and analytical grounding that shape my approach to systems engineering and strategic infrastructure design.

Today, I specialize in designing and maintaining modern, cloud-native platforms that support fast, reliable, and secure software delivery. My strongest capability is Infrastructure as Code, with Terraform as my primary tool for building reproducible, scalable, and auditable cloud environments. I have extensive experience creating Terraform-driven architectures for multi-environment deployments, modular infrastructure stacks, and CI/CD-integrated provisioning workflows.

Beyond Terraform, my core strengths include container orchestration, CI/CD automation, observability engineering, and building systems that are resilient by default. I am passionate about reducing operational toil, enabling engineering velocity, and creating infrastructure that scales intelligently with business needs.

What I Do:
I focus on engineering solutions that make systems more reliable, automated, and observable. My work typically includes:

Cloud Infrastructure Engineering: Architecting and managing environments on AWS, Azure, or GCP using best practices for security, scalability, and cost-efficiency.

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform Expert): Designing modular, version-controlled Terraform stacks to provision cloud resources, enforce consistency, and support safe, automated change management. Also experienced with CloudFormation and Ansible.

CI/CD Automation: Building pipelines using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or ArgoCD to support fast, reliable, and fully automated delivery workflows.

Containers & Orchestration: Operating Kubernetes clusters, containerized applications, service meshes, and GitOps-driven deployment models.

Monitoring, Logging & Alerting: Implementing observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, ELK, Datadog) to improve visibility and reduce MTTR.

SRE Practices: Applying SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, and incident response processes to improve availability and operational excellence.

Operational Automation: Eliminating manual work through scripting, tooling, workflow automation, and consistent infrastructure design patterns.

My Approach:
I bring a systematic and detail-oriented approach to infrastructure and operations:

Automation-first: Every repeatable process should be automated, tested, and integrated into CI/CD.

Reliability by design: Architect systems to self-heal, auto-scale, and degrade gracefully under load.

Security as a core requirement: Enforce least privilege, secret management, compliance, and policy-driven governance from day one.

Observability everywhere: Systems should be measurable, debuggable, and transparent across all layers of the stack.

Continuous improvement: I constantly refine processes, tooling, and workflows to remove friction and strengthen operational performance.

I enjoy solving complex infrastructure problems, simplifying operational workflows, and building platforms that developers trust and enjoy using.
